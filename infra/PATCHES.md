Fixed AVX Windows Builds as per > https://github.com/RobRich999/Chromium_Clang/issues/26#issuecomment-1003605112

.desktop files are created for Thorium itself and content-shell (named thorium-shell), with theses cmdline flags being appended to both via the wrapper file > '--enable-experimental-web-platform-features --new-canvas-2d-api'.

There are also additional desktop actions: when right clicking the Thorium launcher it gives three additional desktop actions, one to open thorium-shell, another to open in Safe Mode which disables any flags one has set in chrome://flags until the next launch, and lastly to open in Dark Mode which appends the --force-dark-mode flag.
