1.1.0.5018:
-TLS code finalized, only iterates through DLLs loaded by this DLL
1.1.0.5017:
-TLS code also added to FlsSetValue wrapper to cover a few remaining TLS bugs that crashed the browser on some XP systems
1.1.0.5016:
-TLS code moved from dedicated functions to being called in InitializeCriticalSectionEx (CRT DllMain calls it on DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) or LoadLibraryEx (in case CRT DllMain
is not used) and FlsGetValue (CRT DllMain calls it on DLL_THREAD_ATTACH) as well as DLL_THREAD_ATTACH in progwrp's DllMain. This was done to allow third-party DLLs with
TLS directories to be loaded dynamically
-Multimedia Timer set to constant ~1.0 ms on NT 5.x and below due to issues with constant timer resolution switches
1.1.0.5015:
-SRW locks revised again, now passing winetests
-WinRT functions introduced

1.1.0.5012:
-Power*Request functions implemented; registry-based supplement for screensaver blocking as SetThreadExecutionState is insufficient on XP

1.1.0.5010:
-A few function stubs added covering uxtheme and ole32, mostly for Windows 2000 targets
-Condition variable implementation rewritten, handle leak eliminated


1.1.0.5002:
-GetDpiForMonitor and ProcessPrng added; this means that bcryptprimitives is now redirected to progwrp.dll in progwrp-native LoadLibrary if the former cannot be located
-getaddrinfo and freeaddrinfo implementations added, enables DNS functionality on Windows 2000
-Slight revision to dynamic TLS allocator in response to Supermium issue #468



1.1.0.5000:
-SRW lock implementation revised, handles no longer used, shared locks now functional
-Slight issues in InitOnceExecuteOnce resolved
-Locale API out-of-bounds checking improved
