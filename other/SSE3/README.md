# Thorium SSE3

This directory contains build config files for compiling Thorium/Chromium with [SSE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE3)

They can also be adapted (and I do exactly this for my occassional SSE4.1 builds) to make [SSE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4), [SSE4.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.1), or [SSE4.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.2) builds.

SSE4.1 could be used, for example, for building for a Core 2 Duo system. \
I make SSE4.2 builds for 1st Gen core, since I have a laptop with a 1st gen "Westmere" CPU.
