# How to use the files in this .zip
# Unpack .zip to wherever

Contains THORIUM_PORTABLE.bat for running portable/standalone.
	
Run INSTALL_THORIUM.cmd to install it to C:\Program Files\Thorium and make shortcuts on the Desktop and Start Menu.

NOTE: If you are installing on a drive where the drive letter is not "C:\", the .cmd files don't need to be modified, 
 however, you must replace all instances of "C:" with the actual drive letter in both of the .reg files.

Run REMOVE_THORIUM.cmd to uninstall it.

You can also skip using THORIUM.BAT and just copy the contents somewhere, and run thorium.exe from within. 
 Note this will make a profile dir in C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Thorium\User Data\ and write a few registry values.

USER_DATA - Contains user profile data.

Thanks for using Thorium and feel free to use the issues or discussions for problems, questions, features, or suggestions.
